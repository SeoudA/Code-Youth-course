    <p> Well, I tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
    Pour myself a cup of ambition</p>

<p>Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
    Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping</p>
    Out on the street, the traffic starts jumping
    With folks like me on the job from 
    <b> 9 to 5 Working 9 to 5</b>
    <p> what a way to make a living
    Barely getting by, it's all taking and no giving
    They just use your mind, and they never give you credit
    It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it </p>
