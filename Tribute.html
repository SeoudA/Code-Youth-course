    <q>Nobody can foretell the outcome, Each decision you make holds meaning only by affecting your next decision.</q>

    <H3>Erwin smith; the 13th commander of the survery corps. A man who was widely respected by his men and humanity. He perfectly embodied everything a leader should have: charisma, selflessness, intelligence and confidence. His comrades placed such trust in his abilities that they were willing to die for him. </H3>
    <P>As a child, Erwin was a curious and insightful individual. Erwin later enlisted in the Training Corps. After graduating, Erwin joined the Survey Corps. He realized that everyone else was fighting for the sake of humanity, whereas he was only fighting for himself. Nonetheless, he thrived as a soldier and eventually was given subordinates under his command. While a Squad Leader, Erwin devised the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation as a way to minimize casualties while on expeditions. His proposal was rejected by then Commander Keith Shadis, who told him to try it when he became commander himself. Although his proposal had been rejected, Erwin began implementing his strategies in his own squad, and over time other soldiers and the populace began to notice that his squad would take no casualties, whereas Shadis would often be the only survivor of his charges.</P>
